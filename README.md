Description: I recreated a design that was given to me to the best of my abilities
Peer Reviewer: Jerrod Packard
Peer Review: The site looks pretty good! I like how you made the text change from Light Mode to Dark Mode on the toggle switch, that's a nice touch. Your colors and spacing look great on desktop and on mobile. The toggle switch isn't quite right though, it's missing the custom gradient background. And it isn't spaced right on mobile. I see you are also missing the hr line at the top on the mobile view. Some of the text sizes seem a little too big and they shouldn't all be bolded, like the usernames and the FOLLOWERS text on the top 4 cards, along with the captions for the bottom cards like Page Views and Likes. I think the text for the green and red letters on all of the cards is supposed to be bold. These are minor differences though and should be quick fixes. Overall, nice work as always Aidan!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
